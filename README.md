# AEKFI (Automatic Extraction of Keywords using Frequent Itemsets)
The Abstract-Automatic Extraction of Keywords using the Frequent Item-sets (AEKFI) technique presents a novel keyword extraction approach that leverages word adjacency within a document. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a corpus, AEKFI automatically identifies the most discriminative words within a document. Introduction of a binomial heap-based approach for AEKFI utilizes binomial minimum heap operations for keyword extraction (insertion, minimum extraction, and deletion).

One notable feature of AEKFI is its flexibility in selecting keywords. It allows for extracting the entire set of keywords from a document or a user-specified number without limiting keyword length. Implementing a Binomial Heap Extractor significantly reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n) compared to existing methods.
